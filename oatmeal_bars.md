# Oatmeal bars

## Ingredients
* 2 cups oats
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon OR punkin pie spice
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
* 1 tsp fake vanilla extract
* Up to 1 cup of various mixins (chocolate chips, walnuts, dried cranberries, coconut flakes, etc!)

## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 350
1. In a small bowl, mix the wet ingredients.
1. In a medium bowl, combine the dry ingredients, except for the mixins.
1. Dump the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, stir, and set aside for 20 minutes. This lets the oats absorb some of the liquid.
1. If any of the mixins are bigger than you'd like, chop them now.
1. After the other ingredients have sat for 20 minutes, stir in the mixins.
1. Line an 8"x8" baking dish with parchment paper. Dump the mixture into the dish and even out as best as possible.
1. Bake for around 35 minutes or until edges are golden. Allow to cool for at least 5 minutes on wire rack before cutting into 8 bars.
