## FAQ
* Are any of the measurements here exact?
  * Nah. I'm guessing based on the last time I made this. I reserve the right to change the ratios. You should too.
* Should I bloom the spices in the oil before adding everything else?
  * Nah. It's not a good idea to do that with basil, and it's not really worth the effort with just the oregano, especially because the sauce simmers for a while.
* Butter AND olive oil, really?
  * Yes, this makes a surprising difference! Italy likes olive oil and France likes butter and they're BOTH right here.
* Sugar, really? That much?
  * Yes, this is also vital! It takes the edge off the acidity of the tomatoes - which is even stronger when using canned.
* No garlic? Red pepper?
  * Add them if you'd like but keep in mind this is just pizza sauce. Don't let it overpower the rest of the stuff on the pizza.
