# Red enchilada sauce

# Ingredients
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 3 tbsp flour
* 1 tbsp chili powder
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp oregano
* lil bit of cinnamon
* lil bit of cayenne
* 2 tsp chicken bouillon
* 2 cups hot water
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
* black pepper
* salt

## Steps
1. Mix together the flour and the spices (except the bouillon.) 
2. Mix the bouillon with the hot water; also, measure out the tomato paste and keep handy.
3. Heat the oil over medium until flour sizzles when added.
4. Add the flour and spices to the oil. Stir constantly for one minute.
5. Stir in the tomato paste.
6. Gradually add the bouillon water while stirring vigorously to avoid lumps.
7. Bring to a simmer and let cook 5-7 minutes or until almost thick enough. It will thicken more as it cools.
8. Add the apple cider vinegar, then salt and pepper to taste.

## Note
This might work with actual chicken broth instead of the bouillon but I'm not 100% sure due to how the broth gummies everything up at cooler temps.
