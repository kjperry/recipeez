# Rib broth

## Ingredients
* Ribs (eaten)
* Water
* Salt

## Steps
1. Cook ribs. Eat ribs. Save bones.
1. Preheat oven to 350.
1. Place rib bones on a baking sheet. Salt generously.
1. Roast ribs in oven for 30 minutes, flipping once halfway through.
1. Remove ribs from oven and place in a ziploc bag.
1. Take ziploc bag of ribs out to the garage and whack 'em real good with a hammer. The more shattered the better; at least crack most of them.
1. Go back inside.
1. Weigh bag, in grams or kilograms.
1. Dump contents of bag in instant pot. Add water: approximately 2 liters per kilogram of bones. Also go ahead and drop in any grease that may have accumulated on the baking sheets.
1. Pressure cook on high for two hours. Natural release.
1. Strain broth through cheesecloth. Broth can be used immediately, or refrigerated overnight, which will let you scoop the fat off the top once it solidifies.
