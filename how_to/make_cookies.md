HOW TO: make cookies
====================

1. Decide you want cookies... tomorrow.
1. A few hours before preparing the dough, get out the butter and the eggs, and put them somewhere to come up to room temperature.
    * Put the eggs in a bowl or something so they don't roll off the counter.
1. When it is time to make the dough, gather the rest of the ingredients.
    * You may see ingredients lists divided into "wet ingredients" and "dry ingredients." Sugar is a "wet" ingredient because it dissolves.
    * Chunky things like chocolate chips and nuts go in at the end and are not really considered dry ingredients either.
1. "Cream together the butter and the sugars." What this means: plop the (room temperature!!) butter and the sugars into a stand mixer and let it go at medium-high speed for a few minutes. It's longer than you'd expect. It should be nice and fluffy and pale in color when it's done.
    * The point is to introduce air into the butter. The air will react with the leavening agents (baking soda, etc) to make the cookies fluffy.
    * This is also why it's vital to use room temperature butter. Butter that's too cold will be hard and won't get enough air. Liquid butter will just dissolve the sugar.
1. Add the eggs, one at a time. Let each egg fully incorporate before adding the next.
    * Too much liquid at once is hard to incorporate without removing the air.
1. Add any other liquids that are called for - gradually!
1. Turn off the mixer. Take the bowl off the mixer.
1. Put a sieve/sifter/strainer/whatever you want to call it on top of a large bowl. Measure the dry ingredients into it.
    * Use a knife to level out flour in the measuring cup.
    * Don't eyeball the leavening agents. (Don't eyeball anything in baking.)
    * You can do this step while the butter and sugars cream.
    * If you don't do this while the butter and sugars cream, you can just put the sifter straight on top of the mixer bowl.
1. Sift the dry ingredients into the bowl. Discard any chunks that won't fit through the holes. Dump the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, if you didn't sift straight into the mixer bowl.
1. Use a wooden spoon to mix the ingredients together a bit.
    * Resist the temptation to skip this step or have the mixer do this part.
      * If you just dump the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and turn on the mixer, you'll get a face full of flour.
      * If you dump the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients gradually while the mixer's running, you'll end up overbeating some of the flour.
1. Put the bowl back on the mixer, turn it on low, and mix until... fully mixed.
    * Basically, just stop when you don't see flour streaks anymore.
    * Don't let it go too long! Overbeating the flour will develop the gluten and give the cookies a weird texture.
1. Add the chocolate chips, nuts etc and mix until evenly combined. Don't overdo it.
1. Turn off the stand mixer, take the bowl off, and scoop the dough into evenly-sized balls.
1. Put the balls in tupperware and refrigerate them. Preferably overnight, but at least an hour.
    * This is vital! Do not skip this!
    * Chilling the dough will harden the butter back up. This will help keep the cookies from spreading too much in the oven.
    * Giving the dough time to sit will make the cookies slightly sweeter because
      1. some of the water from the butter will evaporate, making the sugar concentration denser
      1. the flour will break down slightly and produce more sugar.
1. When it is time to actually bake the cookies, preheat the oven. 350 degrees unless otherwise specified.
1. Get out two cookie sheets. Put a piece of parchment on each of them.
    * Parchment can be reused a few times!
1. Put cookies on baking sheet. I can usually get 6-8 per sheet.
1. Put baking sheets in oven, side-by-side. Avoid putting them on different racks, that'll interfere with the heating patterns.
1. Bake cookies. 9 minutes unless otherwise specified.
    * In general, take them out when the edges are getting slightly browned. They'll continue to cook after you take them out of the oven, so it's okay (even ideal) if they look slightly undercooked.
1. Transfer the cookies to a cooling rack.
1. If you have more dough balls to cook, use different cookie sheets if possible. If you reuse hot ones, you'll burn the bottoms of the cookies.
1. eat cookies
