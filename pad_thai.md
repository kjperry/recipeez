## Ingredients
* 6 oz dry rice noodles
* Vegetable oil
* 8 oz chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces
* 1 large shallot, diced
* 4 garlic cloves, chopped
* 1 tsp ginger, chopped
* 2 eggs
* Salt
* 4.5 tbsp fish sauce
* 4.5 tbsp brown sugar
* 4.5 tbsp rice vinegar
* 3 tsp soy sauce
* lime wedges and crushed peanuts and bean sprouts, etc

## Steps
1. Cook the noodles. Cook them until they are done. Recipes will usually tell you to cook them not until they are done because they will cook more in the wok. These recipes are liars. Do not listen to them.
2. Whisk the eggs and add some salt.
3. Combine the fish sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, and soy sauce in a small bowl.
4. Heat a wok. Cook the chicken in it in a tbsp-ish of vegetable oil. Remove from wok.
5. Heat a tbsp of oil in the wok. Add the shallots, garlic, and ginger, and cook 2-3 minutes.
6. Push the shallots, garlic, and ginger to the outside of the wok and add the eggs. Scramble.
7. Add the noodles. Cook until soft, then mix it all together.
8. Pour in the sauce. Cook a little bit longer, until it is no longer so saucy, and doesn't smell overwhelmingly like fish.
9. Add in the chicken. 
10. Put in bowls and top with lime wedges and crushed peanuts and bean sprouts, etc.
