# Rolls (ALTITUDE ADJUSTED)

## Ingredients
* 1 cup plus 1 tbsp water
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1/2 cup plus 1/2 tbsp milk
* 2 tbsp honey
* 3/4 tbsp yeast
* 3 1/2 cups flour plus more flour
* 1 tsp salt
* Optional: cheese, garlic, herbs

## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 425.
1. Melt the butter.
1. Combine the butter, water, milk, and honey. Microwave at 30-second intervals until mixture reaches 110 degrees. _Do not skip pre-melting the butter; it will not melt below 110 degrees._
1. Pour the liquids into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the bread hook attachment.
1. Sprinkle the yeast on top and stir. Let sit for five minutes or until foamy.
1. Add in the salt and 3 1/2 cups flour. 
1. Turn the mixer on at a 4 speed. Once the dough is combined, add flour until the dough is only slightly sticky to the touch, and pulls away from the sides of the mixer bowl. It might take a lot. 
1. If desired, add a handful of cheese, a lot of garlic, and whatever herbs. I like oregano, thyme, and rosemary. Note: if using jarlic, the extra oil may require adding more flour.
1. Mix for another 5 minutes.
1. Pull dough off hook, cover the bowl with a towel, and let sit for fifteen minutes.
1. Preheat oven to 425.
1. Grease a 9"x13" baking dish.
1. Punch dough down and divide into fifteen balls. Note: yes, this is impossible to do evenly. Don't stress about it.
1. Place balls into baking dish in a little 3x5 grid. Let rise, covered, for another 15 minutes.
1. Remove towel and bake for 12 minutes or until they look done.
