# Ginger-molasses cookies

## Ingredients
* 3/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
* 1/2 cup white sugar
* 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
* 1/4 cup molasses
* 1 egg, room temperature
* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tbsp ground ginger
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp ground cloves
* 1/2 tsp salt
* More sugar

## Steps
1. Cream together the butter and sugars in a stand mixer on medium-high for at least a few minutes.
2. Turn stand mixer speed down to medium-low and add in the eggs one at a time, then molasses.
3. In a different bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and salt.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the stand mixture until combined.
5. Using a cookie scoop, scoop cookies and roll into balls. I usually get 23-24.
6. Refrigerate the dough balls for at least a few hours, preferably overnight.
7. Preheat oven to 350.
8. Roll dough balls in sugar.
9. Bake for 10-ish minutes or until slightly cracked on top. They'll crack more when cooling.
